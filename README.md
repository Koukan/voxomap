# Voxomap
Voxomap is a container of voxels, it's a C++11 header only library.
It was build to be used like a std container, it's templated on user data and it's possible to browse it with iterators.

The container is based on an [octree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree)
and uses a structure in leaves of the tree to improve performance and memory footprint.

For more information, please read the [documentation](https://koukan.github.io/voxomap).
